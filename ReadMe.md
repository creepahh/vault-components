**NLP Summarization Overview**

The NLP engine in ClassVault leverages a pre-trained BERT-based model for extractive text summarization. This model analyzes input text and extracts the most relevant sentences, creating a concise summary. The model is exposed through a Flask-based microservice, which the backend communicates with to summarize academic content like lecture notes, research papers, and assignments.
Key Features of NLP Integration:

Text Summarization: Converts long-form academic content into short, summarized text.
API Communication: The backend (Node.js/Django) communicates with the NLP microservice via HTTP requests to send text and retrieve summaries.
Asynchronous Processing: Summarization requests are handled asynchronously to ensure that the system can process multiple requests efficiently.
Caching: Frequent requests for the same text can be cached to improve performance.

**How It Works**

User Request: The user submits long text (such as notes or assignments) to the backend via a frontend interface.
API Call to NLP Microservice: The backend sends a POST request containing the text to be summarized to the NLP microservice (Flask).
Text Summarization: The NLP microservice processes the input text using a pre-trained BERT-based model (from Hugging Face) to extract key sentences and generate a summary.
Response: The microservice returns the summarized text to the backend, which sends it to the frontend to be displayed to the user.

**Testing the Microservice**

To test the NLP microservice independently, send a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/summarize with a JSON body containing the text to be summarized:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/summarize -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Your lengthy academic text here"}'

The response will contain the summarized text in json format.
